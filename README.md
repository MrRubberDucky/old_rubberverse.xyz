Configs, junk and random stuff that I love losing by either a mistake or deciding I don't need it only to need it later.

Most of stuff here is just used to run some Discord bots (like RetroBot, JMusicBot) and actual sites (ex. https://rubberverse.xyz, https://search.rubberverse.xyz) so might not be very universal or useful but here so I don't lose it.

If you wanna play around with Discord bots then you can hop here - https://discord.gg/FgPGeupWwz, I don't modify the sources of bots so you get more or so the same experience I guess.
